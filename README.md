Pukhraj, also called Yellow Sapphire, is ruled by Jupiter (Guru), the planet of wisdom, fortune, and prosperity. This gemstone is known to bring wealth, knowledge, spiritual growth, and success in all aspects of life. People who face delays in marriage, financial struggles, or career obstacles are often recommended to wear Pukhraj. It is particularly beneficial for those working in teaching, law, finance, or religious fields as it enhances intellect and judgment. On a personal level, Pukhraj strengthens relationships, brings marital harmony, and blesses the wearer with children. It is also said to protect against negative energies, envy, and health issues related to the stomach or liver. Wearing Yellow Sapphire can improve optimism, confidence, and focus in life. To gain full benefits, it should be worn in gold on the index finger after proper astrological advice. Pukhraj is considered one of the most auspicious gemstones, symbolizing wisdom and divine blessings.
